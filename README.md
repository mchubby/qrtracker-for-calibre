# About this Plugin

**QRCode Tracker Filidel** is a free and open source plugin for e-book library management application [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/). It runs in “Edit Book” mode.

Its main purpose is to append a QR code at the end of each chapter in a book. When scanned, this code is converted into a message to help you keep track of your reading progress.

Its use case is for e-readers that are for a reason or another disconnected from internet.

# Installing

 * **Calibre 2.61 or later** is required
 * Download a zipped copy of this repository, using a [tagged release](https://github.com/mchubby/qrtracker-for-calibre/releases/latest). Notice: at this point, Calibre requires files packed inside zip to sit at **top-level of archive** and not in a subdirectory. Download the zip marked as **RELEASE**.
 * Install this ZIP using the Calibre "preferences > plugins" dialog. [Click here for a tutorial with images](http://www.ismoothblog.com/2012/07/how-to-install-plugin-to-calibre.html) in case you cannot find it.

# Using
 * Open a book in the calibre editor
 * Click **Menu Plugins -> “Filidel: Add QR trackers”**
 * Review changes to your book, then save.

# Customizing the appearance

Generated images are version 2 QR tags, which have a variable width. I'm not sure if I have control over that.

On the other hand, the following piece of HTML is appended at the end of each chapter:
```html
<aside id="qrtracker" class="qrtracker"><img src="../filidelqr-c01.png"/>
</aside>
```

Assuming each chapter link to a CSS stylesheet, you could use the following excerpt to center the paragraph:
```CSS
.qrtracker {
    text-align: center
}
```
