# About this Plugin

**QRCode Tracker Filidel** is a free and open source plugin for e-book library management application [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/). It runs in “Edit Book” mode.

Its main purpose is to append a QR code at the end of each chapter in a book. When scanned, this code is converted into a message to help you keep track of your reading progress.

Its use case is for e-readers that are for a reason or another disconnected from internet.
